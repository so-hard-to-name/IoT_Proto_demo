About the running
    - port 8080 and 8081 are needed
    - port 8080 is used to show data and history in browser (can be modified in server.py line 6)
    - port 8081 is used to listen to the data sent from sensor or devices (can be modified in soc.py line 5)

About the file
    - server.py -> for user to check the data
    - client.py -> (for test)send data to socket server and save the data
    - soc.py    -> Socket server to get the data from sensor or devices
    - temperature.txt -> A txt file used to save data, normally it should be a database

Usage
    - server.py
        * run the file and open the "localhost:8080" in browser to see the data
    - soc.py & client.py (for test)
        * run soc.py to start the socket server
        * run client.py to send data to server
        * the data will be handled and saved in file "temperature.txt"
    
    - When test with sensor/devices
        * Please only send the temperature value (for example: 23)
        * Connect the computer and the devices to the same Wifi or local network
        * Check the IP address of computer and set address "IP Address:8081"(if changed int he .py file, also change it here)
